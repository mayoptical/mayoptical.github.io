                        <p class="paragraphs">Established in 1985 by Paul Lau, May Optical was founded with the goal of helping its community see better - from our original downtown location to our current Scarborough store, where we have been since 2005. Ever the family oriented
                            business, May Optical is now owned and operated by Paulâ€™s daughter Carmen, who has over 20 years of experience in the optical industry. We remain a friendly neighbourhood optical that is now welcoming our fourth generation
                            of patients.
